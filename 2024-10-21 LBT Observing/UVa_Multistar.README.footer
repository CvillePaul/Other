Calibrations:
Standard PEPSI calibrations.
For accurate sky subtraction, we request a sky fiber be taken at the time of observing. 

Obtaining multiple measurements of the targets is desireable.
Because these are relatively short period systems, followup measurements as little as 6 hours apart will be of use in determining orbital parameters.
Repeat measurements of longer cadence are equally useful.
