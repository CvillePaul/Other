    "* Test if observable from APO during the A half of 2024-09-16.  If not, move on to the next brightest binary\n",
    "* Search Gaia for a radius 110% of the separation of that binary, centered on the WDS coordinates\n",
    "* If you don't get exactly 2 stars in that query, move on to the next brightest binary\n",
    "* We now have Gaia's version of the binary.  Use the Gaia info for PA, separation, magnitudes, etc.\n",
    "* From the midpoint of the Gaia binary, do a new Gaia search for point sources with the following criteria:\n",
    "  * a 4' radius around the binary\n",
    "  * within 1 mag of the brighter of the two components of the binary\n",
    "* If there are no point sources found, move on to the next brightest binary\n",
    "* For each of the possibly multiple point sources found, enter the binary & point source info in the targets table\n",
